# Explanation 
In this program we design a translator which get an input *PDF* file and extract the lines and text then 
it sends them to the next function which has the responsibility of translating the extracted text after that it is *write_to_file* turn to write the translated sentences in a txt format file and save it for you.
point : It is mentioned to check if the line is filled with 10 words then go to the next line.
